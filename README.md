# 5300-Dolphin
DB Relation Manager project for CPSC5300/4300 at Seattle U, Spring 2020 

## Sprint Invierno
**Milestone 5:** </br>
Insert, Delete, Simple Queries - rudimentary implementation of certain INSERT, DELETE and simple SELECT statements.</br>

**General Steps:** </br>
1. Git clone or download this repo
2. Compile the code by runing "make"
3. Run "./sql5300 ../data" (Should make directory of "data" outside the repo first)
4. Try example test commands as below
5. Enter "quit" to exit

**Test Steps for M5:** (Create Table, Show Table/Columns and Drop Table)
